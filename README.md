# 🎓 College Management System (Java + MySQL)

This is a **College Management System** built using **Java** and **MySQL**, developed as part of my journey to become a **Java Backend Engineer**. My goal is to first **master the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java and gradually move towards advanced backend development.

## 🚀 Purpose of the Project

I'm currently practicing OOP in Java to build a solid foundation before diving deeper into backend frameworks and enterprise tools like Spring Boot. This project helps me:

- Apply real-world OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction).
- Practice working with **MySQL databases** using **XAMPP** and **phpMyAdmin**.
- Understand how backend systems manage data and operations.
